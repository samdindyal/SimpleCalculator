# SimpleCalculator

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to create a simple calculator application with whole numbers as inputs.

This application is a graphical representation of of the assignment listed above. The UI of this calculator features a segmented control to adjust the operator on which two numbers are operated on and is dynamically updated on user input.
